## Preparation

Update `gitpod.yml` to install cfn-lint, cfn-guard, cfn-toml, etc.

Create two S3 buckets `cfn-artifacts-beici` and `codepipeline-cruddur-artifacts-beici` by:

```
aws s3 mb s3://cfn-artifacts-222
export CFN_BUCKET="cfn-artifacts-222"
gp env CFN_BUCKET="cfn-artifacts-222"

aws s3 mb s3://codepipeline-cruddur-artifacts-222
```

## Template and Config

Create a new folder `aws/cfn` to save template and config (change to your own parameters) for each CloudFormation stack, including:

- Base networking components: `networking/template.yaml` and `networking/config.toml`
- Networking and cluster configuration to support Fargate containers: `cluster/template.yaml` (change to your own namespace) and `cluster/config.toml`
- RDS database for the application: `db/template.yaml` and `db/config.toml`
- Fargate backend service: `service/template.yaml` (change to your own namespace, role and policy names) and `service/config.toml`
- CICD for the backend servie: `cicd/nested/codebuild.yaml`, `cicd/template.yaml`, `cicd/config.toml`
- Frontend: `frontend/template.yaml` and `frontend/config.toml`
- Sync changes for the frontend: `sync/template.yaml` and `sync/config.toml`
- Dedicated user role for CFN: `machine-user/template.yaml` and `machine-user/config.toml`

## Command

Create and run command scripts for the above CFN, then we can execute the change set and check the output on AWS CloudFormation.

- Run `./bin/cfn/networking` to create `CrdNet` stack.
- Run `./bin/cfn/cluster` to create `CrdCluster` stack.
- Edit Route53 type A records for `api.beici-demo.xyz` to point to the `CrdClusterALB`.
- Export `DB_PASSWORD` and run `./bin/cfn/db` to create `CrdDb` stack.
- It will take some time to create the RDS database `cruddur-instance`. When it's done, get its endpoint, and update the `CONNECTION_URL` in AWS System Manager's Parameter Store.
- Run `./bin/cfn/service` to create `CrdSrvBackendFlask` stack.
- Use SAM to run `./ddb/build` (to create `.aws-sam`), then `./ddb/package`, and finally `./ddb/deploy`, in order to create `CrdDdb` stack.
- Use the created DDB table from above step as the value for `DDBMessageTable` to update `aws/cfn/service/template.yaml` and `aws/cfn/service/config.toml`, then run again `./bin/cfn/service`.
- Run `./bin/cfn/frontend` to create `CrdFrontend` stack. At this stage, no frontend code is deployed to it, so we need to setup static building and syncing in the following sections.
- Edit Route53 type A records for `zoro-chi.com.ng` and `www.zoro-chi.com.ng` to point to the CloudFront created by `CrdFrontend`.
- Delete the old AWS codepipeline and codebuild and run `./bin/cfn/cicd` to create `CrdCicd` stack and a nested one.
- Run `./bin/cfn/machineuser` to create `CrdMachineUser` stack. In IAM > Users > cruddur_machine_user > create access key, then update the generated key in Parameter Store.

To successfully pass the health check in the backend service, worth checking the following settings:

- Parameter Store set to correct `CONNECTION_URL`, `AWD_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
- RDS database created by `CrdDb` is running.
- Security group `CrdDbRDSSG` has a inbound rule that sets to port 5432 and sources `CrdClusterServSG`.
- Security group `CrdClusterServSG` has a inbound rule that sets to port 4567 and source `CrdClusterALBSG`.
- Security group `CrdClusterALBSG` has inbound rules to allow all HTTP and HTTPS traffics.
- Edit health check settings for the target group of `CrdClu-Backe-XXX`, in advanced settings, set the health check port to override port 4567.
- Make sure Route53's type A records are using the correct routes.

Now if we merge this week-10 branch to the prod branch, it will trigger CICD. In AWS, Developer Tools > Connections > CrdCicd-connection, update pending connection. If successful, `https://api.zoro-chi.com.ng/api/health-check` will return `{"success":true,"ver":1}`. A screenshot of succeeded pipeline is attached below.

## Static Website Hosting for Frontend

We use a Ruby-based tool to sync a folder from local development to S3 bucket, and then invalidate the CloudFront cache.

Create the following scripts:

- `./bin/frontend/static-build` and `./bin/frontend/sync`
- `./erb/sync.env.erb` (change to your own `SYNC_S3_BUCKET` and `SYNC_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`)
- `./tmp/.keep` as a placeholder
- `Gemfile`
- `Rakefile`
- `./bin/cfn/sync`

Also update `./bin/frontend/generate-env` and frontend components.

Now we initialize the static hosting by uploading the frontend to S3 bucket:

- run `./bin/frontend/static-build`
- `cd frontend-react-js` then `zip -r build.zip build/`
- download and decompress the zip, and upload everything inside the build folder to s3://beici-demo.xyz

For syncing:

- Install by `gem install aws_s3_website_sync dotenv`
- Run `./bin/frontend/generate-env` to generate `sync.env`
- Run `./bin/frontend/sync` to sync
- Run `./bin/cfn/sync` to create stack `CrdSyncRole`, add the permissions by creating an inline policy `S3AccessForSync` for the created `CrdSyncRole` with S3 service, actions of GetObject, PutObject, ListBucket and DeleteObject, resources specific to bucket `zoro-chi.com.ng`, and resource with the same bucket and any object.

Later if frontend is changed, we can sync by running `./bin/frontend/static-build` and then `./bin/frontend/sync`.

## Settings for DB

In order to do some DB migration from gitpod, we firstly need to edit inbound rules for `CrdDbRDSSG` to allow gitpod IP. Then update the following env according to our CFN:

```sh
export GITPOD_IP=$(curl ifconfig.me)
export DB_SG_ID="your_security_group_id_of_CrdDbRDSSG"
gp env DB_SG_ID="your_security_group_id_of_CrdDbRDSSG"
export DB_SG_RULE_ID="corresponding_sgr_for_gitpod"
gp env DB_SG_RULE_ID="corresponding_sgr_for_gitpod"
export PROD_CONNECTION_URL='postgresql://cruddurroot:<your_password>@<endpoint_of_cruddur-instance>:5432/cruddur'
gp env PROD_CONNECTION_URL='postgresql://cruddurroot:<your_password>@<endpoint_of_cruddur-instance>:5432/cruddur'

./bin/rds/update-sg-rule
./bin/db/schema-load prod
```

Since we need to add other columns to the RDS DB, run `./bin/generate/migration reply_to_activity_uuid_to_string` to generate `backend-flask/db/migrations/xxxxx_reply_to_activity_uuid_to_string.py`, edit this python file and then run `CONNECTION_URL=$PROD_CONNECTION_URL ./bin/db/migrate`. Column `bio` will be added to the `users` table, and `reply_to_activity_uuid` added to the `activities` table.

Plus, in `cruddur-post-confirmation` Lambda, change `CONNECTION_URL`, VPC (change to the ones created by CFN, create a new `CognitoLambdaSG` with the `CrdNet` VPC), edit inbound rules of `CrdDbRDSSG` to allow `CognitoLambdaSG`.


Since the backend is updated, we can trigger CICD by merging this branch to the prod branch. Since the frontend is also updated, we can sync by running `./bin/frontend/static-build` and then `./bin/frontend/sync`.
